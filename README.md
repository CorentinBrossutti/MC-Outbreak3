Minecraft server version : SPIGOT 1.8.8
Ready-to-go binaries included and config files included in _readybin_ folder. Thanks to CrackShot and Citizens teams. Just put all of those in your _plugins_ folder.
Advised to fiddle a bit with the spigot entity limit in spigot.yml if you use zombie zones a lot because spigot can limit the amount of entities in a given area.

Outbreak v3 is a minecraft plugin that converts your normal minecraft server into a configurable zombie apocalypse RP server with no modifications on client side.

Short list of edits (see wiki for more details) :

- Zombies are now much stronger and are more intelligent with a complex AI, detection based on outfit, distance and player behaviour (sneaking, sprinting, etc)
- Zones defined via a command where zombies are allowed to spawn in much greater numbers. Once a sufficient amount of zombies is killed in this area spawning is toggled off for a given period of time. Very useful for loot-heavy areas
- Loots and packs, loots are single objects on the ground (3D effect included) picked up via right-click, packs are chests containing randomized elements from a given set among configurable sets (for example, military set, town set, etc). Loots objects are also determined from the same sets and different weight can be applied to objects (a sniper is still rarer in military set than canned food). Respawn time is defined per set.
- Weapons addon for CrackShot to include recoil, glassbreak, etc
- Backpack addon
- Thirst addon using the experience bar
- And more
